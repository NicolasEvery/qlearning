# Deep Q-Network Robots Gym

This educational project trains robotic systems within simulated environments using the advanced MuJoCo physics engine alongside the Menagerie framework. The project leverages state-of-the-art reinforcement learning techniques, specifically Deep Q-Networks (DQN), to enable robots to learn and perform complex tasks in realistic physics-based simulations.
